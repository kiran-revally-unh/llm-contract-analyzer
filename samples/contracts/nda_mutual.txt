NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:

a) Technical data, trade secrets, know-how, research, product plans, products, services, customers, customer lists, markets, software, developments, inventions, processes, formulas, technology, designs, drawings, engineering, hardware configuration information, marketing, finances, or other business information.

b) Any information that is marked "Confidential," "Proprietary," or with a similar designation.

a) Hold and maintain the Confidential Information in strict confidence;

e) Limit access to the Confidential Information to its employees, contractors, and advisors who have a legitimate need to know and who have been informed of the confidential nature of such information.

3. PERMITTED DISCLOSURES

The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants, attorneys, and advisors (collectively, "Representatives") who have a need to know such information for the Purpose, provided that such Representatives are bound by confidentiality obligations no less restrictive than those contained in this Agreement.

4. EXCEPTIONS

a) Was known to the Receiving Party prior to disclosure by the Disclosing Party, as evidenced by written records;

b) Is or becomes publicly available through no breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party;

c) Is rightfully received by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation;

d) Is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Confidential Information, as evidenced by written records;

5. TERM

This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue for a period of five (5) years, unless earlier terminated by either Party upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the other Party.

6. SURVIVAL

The obligations of confidentiality set forth in this Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement and shall continue for a period of five (5) years from the date of disclosure of the Confidential Information.

7. RETURN OR DESTRUCTION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

Upon termination of this Agreement or upon written request by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall, at the Disclosing Party's option, either:

a) Return all Confidential Information, including all copies, notes, and derivatives, to the Disclosing Party; or

b) Destroy all Confidential Information and certify such destruction in writing to the Disclosing Party.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party may retain one archival copy of Confidential Information solely for purposes of determining its ongoing obligations under this Agreement, provided such copy remains subject to the confidentiality obligations herein.

ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO ITS ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, OR PERFORMANCE.

11. REMEDIES

12. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.
